### What End User Data do I store?
I do not store any personally identifiable data.
I only store the data users input for their Blades Clocks which are clock name, 
tag, size and amount of ticks
To identify which clocks are yours we also store your discord user_id

### Who do I share data with?
I not share any data with third parties.

### How long do I store data for?
I store input data indefinetly, to ensure users have access to their clocks. 
If you delete all your clocks, your user_id is also removed from the server automatically

### How do I store the data?
The data is just stored on the raspberry pi that hosts the bot. 
There are no special security measure to ensure data remains consistent or unchanged.
I don't make any backups of the data either.

### How can I contact you if I have concerns about your bot?
If you have any concerns you can contact me in my support server (https://discord.gg/fcJ7tQW9Ps)
or send me an email at benjamin.wenger00@gmail.com

## How can I request data to be removed?
As I do not store any personally identifiable data, so you cannot request it to be removed.
We have commands you can use to delete any data connected to yourself and your clocks.
